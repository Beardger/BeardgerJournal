  <p id="HydrogenText" class="Explanations"> It's lighter than air and is normally found as a molecule, H<sub>2</sub>; over a certain activation energy makes a chain reaction with O<sub>2</sub>, releasing a lot of heat as a colorless flame; this energy can be harnessed for clean energy production and atomic bombs (cf. Li)  </p>

  <p id="HeliumText" class="Explanations"> It boils at 4Â°K and at low temperature behaves like a superfluid, which can be used in MRI technology; it is a byproduct of hydrogen fusion in star cores and it forms as an alpha particle is released in radioactive decay; most naturally occurring helium on our planet comes from this process </p>
